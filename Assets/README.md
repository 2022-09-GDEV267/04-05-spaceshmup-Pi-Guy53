For Juiciness'I would add some form of hit indicator, possible with a damage number readout so that once we add health to the enemies the player has some visual cue that they hit their target.
Destruction animations/particles will also make the destruction of the ships look better, rather than them just disappearing.

As the video mentioned, adding sounds will make the game feel 'better' Shooting, enemy hit, enemy destroyed, and player destroyed,
as well as background music would all be in the realm of possibility.

To extend the game I have a few ideas. Additional ship types, such as a boss ship, or a support ship
(one that heals, or boosts the damage of other ships) additional weapon types (other than those that will be added in the next chapter) I would like to try my hand at a missile, and or some form of AOE weapon.

Remaking the environment so that the player can fly around in any direction rather than constantly 'moving forward'
would be fun gameplay, but may take too long to implement.
