To extend the game I have a few ideas. Additional ship types, such as a boss, or a support ship
(one that heals, or boosts the damage of other ships)
and I would like to add some addition weapons including missiles, and/or some form of AOE weapon.
Phasers/Lasers also seem like they would be intersting to have.

Remaking the environment so that the player can fly around in any direction rather than constantly 'moving forward'
would be fun gameplay, but may take too long to implement. I have a working concept, but will wait until our mash up
to impliment.

I added 2 additional shots to the spread weapon, bringing it up to 5 per shot.
The blaster now shoots 20 shots per second, each dealing .5 damage. DPS = 10
The spread weapon shots 12.5 shots per second, each dealing 1 damage. DPS = 12.5
I balanced it as such because the spread weapon often misses most of its shots, and so by giving it a higher DPS than the blaster
it stays competative late game. The spread really only deals max damage at extreme close range, which is dangerous for the player
also added a new Cannon weapon. Massive single shot damage, low fire rate. Currently does 8 damage per shot, with a fire delay of .8
Cannon DPS = 10 While unweildly in low quantites, this weapon can become OP with 2+ weapons equipped.
